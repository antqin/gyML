support your left hand on your left knee, the left foot steps on the ground in a diagonal backward direction, and keep your back straight. lead your right shoulder forward, hold the dumbbell, and keep your arms perpendicular to the ground. use your back to force and pull your big arms backward and upward against the body until the elbows are slightly above the torso, and stop briefly at the highest point. unload the force slowly, restore to the starting position, and do not fully relax at the lowest point.
