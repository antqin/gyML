sit on the yoga mat, keep your legs slightly bent and hip-width apart, and keep your back straight. when inhaling, extend your head and spine towards the ceiling. when exhaling, roll your tailbone toward the pubis, tighten the pelvic floor muscles, tilt the pelvis backward, and slowly flex the spine backward. make your spine form a "c" with a sense of extension. inhale and return to the starting position.
