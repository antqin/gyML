lie flat on your yoga mat, bend your knees, spread your legs shoulder-width apart, and keep your feet firmly planted on the ground. sink your shoulder blades so that your upper back is flat against the mat. hold the dumbbells with both hands opposite each other, place them right above your chest with your fists facing each other and keep your arms perpendicular to the ground. bend your elbows slightly, open your arms, lower the dumbbells to the ground, pause briefly and return to the starting position. control the movement speed when lowering the dumbbells, and do not touch the ground; do not collide the dumbbells when your arms fold.
